  <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
  <p>Coventry Roleplay is a community-run fan project, not affiliated with Roblox. This site allows users to submit suggestions to improve our services.</p>

  <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you submit a suggestion, we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Roblox username (as you provide it)</li>
    <li>Your suggestion text</li>
    <li>Your IP address (automatically captured by our server)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Why We Collect IP Addresses</h2>
  <p>Your IP address is logged for security and abuse-prevention purposes. This helps us detect and block inappropriate or abusive submissions.</p>

  <h2>4. How Long We Store Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Normal submissions: IP addresses are stored for <strong>30 days</strong> and then deleted.</li>
    <li>Banned users: If your IP is banned due to abuse, the banned IP is stored indefinitely to prevent future abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
  <p>Under the UK GDPR, we process IP addresses on the basis of <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (security and abuse prevention). 
  We only collect and store the minimum data necessary for this purpose.</p>

  <h2>6. Who Has Access</h2>
  <p>Only authorised community administrators have access to the logs. We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Under UK GDPR, you have rights to access or request deletion of your personal data. However, if your IP has been banned due to abuse, 
  we reserve the right to retain it to protect our community.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, please contact us at: <em>[your contact email here]</em></p>
